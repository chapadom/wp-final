Web Mapping: Final Project

This project explores Citi Bike usage* per station,
annually and daily in 2018.

* Usage measures the number of times that a bike
was docked or undocked at a particular station
(to begin or end a ride).

Data was sourced from CitiBike, from January to December 2018,
and reshaped in R to obtain aggregates at the station level.
